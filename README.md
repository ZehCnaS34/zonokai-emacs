# Zonokai theme
A blue based theme for emacs. With green red yellow orange accent colors.

The theme started out as just a blue one, but it now supports a red version.
The red version is generated by taking the complement of the blue version with some
tweaks to make the visibility of the red one more pleasing to the eye.
btw, I still like the blue theme better.

### Compatibility
This theme is made for emacs 24 and up.

## Installing
This theme is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) package.el
If you don't have that repo, add it and then run a.

`M-x package-install zonokai-theme`

Then

`M-x  load-theme`

The default theme (and advised one) is Zonokai-blue. To load the blue
theme add:

	(load-theme 'zonokai-blue t)
	
to your Emacs configuration.

the Zonokai-red theme is still being polished. But if you still would like
to try it out, add:

	(load-theme 'zonokai-red t)



Tell me how you like it. If you want to add some font faces, just make a pull
