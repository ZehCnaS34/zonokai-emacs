# Zonokai theme
A blue based theme for emacs. With green red yellow orange accent colors.

This theme is made for emacs 24 and up.

## Installing
This theme is available on [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) package.el
If you don't have that repo, add it and then run a.

`M-x package-install zonokai-theme`

Then

`M-x  load-theme`

The default theme (and advised one) is zonokai-blue. To load that
theme add `(load-theme 'zonokai-blue t)` to your Emacs configuration.

the Zonokai-red theme is still being polished. But if you still would like
to try it out, add this line.
`(load-theme 'zonokai-blue t)`

Tell me how you like it. If you want to add some font faces, just make a pull




### Customizing
if you want to use the lighter theme then use this
`(setq zk-complement t)`

By default, the darker theme will be used.

## Complement version
all I did to achieve the complement version take the complement of each color.
hence the name....
